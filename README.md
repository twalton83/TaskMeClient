# Task.Me - Client

This is a refresh of an existing fullstack project I have. This version is frontend only, and leverages classes and localStorage rather than MongoDB + Mongoose schemas. 

I am leveraging MaterialUI for the components, CSS-in-JS, and a custom palette I chose. I enjoy MaterialUI simply because it's clean, has a robust API for all of its components, and the CSS-in-JS functionality of useStyles makes it very easy to make my own customizations. Ultimately, I care more about the underlying logic, so using MaterialUI allows me to focus more on that, rather than the design aspect. 

The inspiration for this was ultimately Asana, which is a useful SaaS tool frequently used for project management.
