# Task.Me - Client

This is a refresh of an existing fullstack project I have. This version is frontend only, and leverages classes rather than MongoDB + Mongoose schemas. Ultimately, this repo will be refactored in itself to connect to a REST API, but I wanted to double down on traditional OOP principles and patterns, rather than working with schemas. 

The inspiration for this was ultimately Asana, which is a useful SaaS tool frequently used for project management.
